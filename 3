3. Merge a Linked List into Another Linked List at Alternate Positions

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def merge_alternate(head1, head2):
    current1 = head1
    current2 = head2
    
    while current1 and current2:
        next1 = current1.next
        next2 = current2.next
        
        current1.next = current2
        current2.next = next1
        
        current1 = next1
        current2 = next2
    
    return head1
